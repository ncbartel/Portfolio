# Wireframes / storyboards



# User research 

## Target audience
My target audience are American voters who feel as if politics is failing and that people "just don't get along and respect each other anymore". I am intentionally designing it for those who might be slightly right leaning and are interested in willing to work with pro-green energy people but feel that their opinion is uncommon within their political party.

## Interview script
My goals were based off of the critique methods discussed in class looking at positive elements, negative aspects, perceived audience, and initial impressions. 


| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|Positive Elements|What are elements of this story that you found were positive in the story?|
|Negative Elements|What are some elements of this study that you found could be improved? How would you suggest that it change?|
|Perceived Audience|Based upon how you viewed it, what do you believe was the target audience of this?|
|Initial Impressions|Given the visualizations, what are your first thoughts when it comes to this?|
