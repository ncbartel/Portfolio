# User research 

## Target audience
My target audience are American voters who feel as if politics is failing and that people "just don't get along and respect each other anymore". I am intentionally designing it for those who might be slightly right leaning and are interested in willing to work with pro-green energy people but feel that their opinion is uncommon within their political party.

## Interview script
My goals were based off of the critique methods discussed in class looking at positive elements, negative aspects, perceived audience, and initial impressions. 


| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|Positive Elements|What are elements of this story that you found were positive in the story?|
|Negative Elements|What are some elements of this study that you found could be improved? How would you suggest that it change?|
|Perceived Audience|Based upon how you viewed it, what do you believe was the target audience of this?|
|Initial Impressions|Given the visualizations, what are your first thoughts when it comes to this?|



## Interview findings

Interview 1: Male, Early 20s, Highest Education Attained: Some College, Conservative Republican

Interview 2: Female, Early 20s, Highest Education Attained: Graduate School, Moderate Democrat

Interview 3: Female, Early 20s, Highest Education Attained: Bachelor's, Liberal Democrat

Interview 4: Female, Early 50s, Highest Education Attained: Ph.D., Moderate Democrat


| Questions               | Interview 1 (briefly describe) | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
|What are elements of this story that you found were positive in the story?|"I like the intext citations for basically everything. It makes it very easy to see where data is being pulled from"|             |             |
|What are some elements of this study that you found could be improved? |Did not like the comparison of tons of CO2 to weight of elephants and said it felt "like a children's pop up book". Also felt the audience changed from the body of the story to the conclusion shifting from mainly targeting more pro-environment conservatives to Green and more liberal Democrats in the call to action.|             |             |
|How would you suggest that it change?|Suggested that the phrasing change to be more audience appropriate and "if you're looking to try to bridge the gap I would make a call to action focusing on points of agreement between people who are usually pro green energy and people who are usually anti green energy"| |             |
|Based upon how you viewed it, what do you believe was the target audience of this?| I think that the intended audience is supposed to be a general audiences or even a more right leaning audience but the call to action slams you right back into a green/leftwing audience category|
