# Changes made since Part II

One of the most important changes that I made since Part II was shifting the message to be more targeted as a pro-science conservative audience. Based upon feedback from Part II, it was clear that using quotes from Republican leaders and adding in reference points made it seem as if I was talking down to my audience who may have a belief of liberal elitism and feeling intellectually superior over conservatives which was not the intent of the original message. Instead of referencing top Republicans who were both funded and supported the fossil fuel industry, I instead shifted the message to be more targeting fossil fuel companies promoting apathy and disengagement on climate change.

I also changed the percent of Americans wanting to violently protest against the U.S. government, as while it was an interesting fact, it added unnecessary information to the story that was not necessary. I opted to remove it because it did not fit with the flow of the narrative and required a more intricate transition between the topics where just discussing the lack of perceived civility hit the same point and had a smoother transition. 

Another change I did was with the billion dollar disasters section where I reframed it to be more individual stories rather than the property damage alone. This is mainly to have my audience have a greater chance of relating with the people who have been harmed due to climate-enhanced natural disasters instead of a generic damage statistic. I chose to use individual stories over large statistics because I wanted to make it more personal and relatable to the audience.

Based on in-class critiques of the part II project, for the climate scientist consensus portion, I clarified what human activities have been influential in climate change. 

In the renewable energy line chart section, I changed the colors to be blue for a positive color with renewable energy and orange as an alert color for fossil fuels. I also switched it from a full sentence to having them on top of each other to promote parallelism within the information.

For the Climate Taboo section, I shifted it to a dark theme to demarcate the conflict aspect of the story. I also changed the color palette to mirror the story narrative. At first it is colorful and flashy to keep the viewer's attention and get them hooked for the rest of the story. Then, I switch into the dark theme as it shifts into the "darker" conflict of the story. In changing to target Big Oil instead of individual politicians generally, I intentionally selected a oil well in the evening as the red of the sky is another alert color and I also highlighted via changing the text color to also be red the more dramatic parts of the statement. This idea of using red to highlight the important parts of the statements continued throughout the conflict part of the story.

I then switch back to the light theme for the conclusion where I introduce more positive information. I also change the highlight color from red to green which is associated more with nature and environmentalism. I made sure it is not on the same page as the red to be inline with keeping the chance of my audience having red-green color blindness in mind in minimizing confusion. For the "America's Energy Desires" part of the story, while there is some overlap between orange and red, I decided to use that over red to again avoid red-green colorblindness complications and also avoiding the "Christmas Tree effect" discussed in class. 

I also redesigned the recommendations to be more specific to the topic while still using a more memorable acronym of A.I.R (Assert science-backed evidence in regular conversations, Ignore Carbon Purity Shaming, and Report disinformation online). This was, in-part, inspired by climate communicator Michael E. Mann's book "The New Climate War" and his fact-based approach on engaging people realistically on climate change.
