# Welcome!
Welcome to my page! This page was designed as part of the Telling Stories with Data course at Carnegie Mellon University in the Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy. If you found me from somewhere else (or if Google indexes this site and you clicked from there), welcome! I invite you to take a look around and see what I have done for this course. 

# About me
So biggest question is who am I? Well hello! My name is Nickolas Bartel (he/him/his). I am a first year Master of Public Policy and Management student with an Environmental Policy concentration. I graduated Washington & Jefferson College with a Bachelor of Arts majoring in Political Science, Environmental Studies, and Spanish with a minor in Latin American Studies. There, a class I took  My main research interest is in engaging resistant communities with climate policy and other environmental issues. 

While attending Carnegie Mellon University, you might also find me working at the Carnegie Science Center as a Program Presenter presenting live shows since May 2016 on electricity, liquid nitrogen, the brain, and much more! One of my favorite floor demonstrations I designed working there was using the Stroop test to show how word recognition during the test in different languages impacts completion time. 

After graduating in May 2025, I plan to explore my interests working in either a non-profit or local/state goverment to find ways to address climate policy to help the next generation to live in a cleaner and safer world. If you are interested in what I have done or want to throw around ideas, feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickolas-bartel/)!


# What I hope to learn
In this class, in the beginning of the semester, these were the areas that I was really curious in exploring:
- Finding ways to make complicated data into easy to understand platforms
- Developing ways to take raw data and create compelling narratives 
- Improving design skills to help create effective designs
