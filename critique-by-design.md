# Critique by Design with Tableau

## Overview of Original Visualization 
The <a href = "https://data.world/makeovermonday/2021w27" target="_blank">If Only ____ Voted</a> visualization outlined how depending on the demographic group the 2020 US Presidential Election using data would have resulted between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. The visualization made by Dustin Gibson on Reddit originating from the AP News Exit polling has individual electoral maps per demographic group. 

## Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile of Original Visualization

### Positive Aspects of the Original Visualization

Based on the <a href ="http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/data_visualization_effectiveness_profile.pdf" target ="_blank">Data Visualization Profile</a> by Stephen Few, this visualization was evaluated on usefullness, completeness, perceptibility, truthfulness, intuitiveness, aesthetics, and engagement. 

**Usefulness**
*4/10*

I believe that this visualization earned a 4 as while it was perceptable, it was very long image that was hard to view on the website. This would make it harder for the intended audience to pull the information they wanted out of the visualization. Additionally, through using a U.S. map, it was hard to evaluate the popular vote that each candidate won by in each state. 

 This was posted under r/dataisbeautiful Reddit thread which means that this was designed for Reddit users who are politically interested with U.S. politics. With a release date 3 years ago, this was likely following the January 6th Insurrection attacks where the question of who voted for President Biden versus former President Trump was on the minds of people interested in this election. The diagram matching the intended audience and the format being relevant to the topic is what earned this visualization a 4. 

**Completeness** 

*7/10*

I rated this a 7 out of 10 because while the visualization does have all of the demographics within the dataset from AP News, it is missing the popular vote percentages which leads to an incomplete visualization of the data. It is important to include the popular vote as electoral votes are not representative of the total population as some states such as New Hampshire or Montana have a lower population to electoral college representative ratio compared to states such as California. However, it does include electoral victories and the summation of each candidate at the top, so this was a positive aspect increasing its score. So while most of the data is there, this visualization receives a 7.  

**Perceptibility** 

*4/10*

I rated this a 4 out of 10 as the image at first glance is very long and that leads it to be presented as very narrow and impossible to read without having to zoom into the iamge which prevents viewing the entirety of the visualization. It also uses a map-based approach which does not adequately reflect the concentrations of voters making it seem like one party is in more control color wise than it actually does population or even electoral college wise. It did recieve some points as it included the horizontal stacked bar chart visualization showing the totals for both Trump and Biden. However, overall, this visualization was challenging to read. 

**Truthfulness**

*10/10*

This visualization gets a 10 out of 10 as the data originates from AP News, a broadly accepted non-partisan news source. The data itself represents the data accurately in a commonly understood manner. The only minor critique on this was that the land area of the United States can be mistaken on the scale as representative of the population.

**Intuitiveness** 

*7/10*

This visualization gets a 7 out of 10 as the data does convey the message moderately well. However, I knocked 3 points off as it is challenging to view the different demographics easily without zooming in on the image itself which then requires scrolling. The map gives a clear, intuitive representation that the data is explaining voting information about the United States which is the main objective of using this display format. 

**Aesthetics**

*4/10*

I rated this a 4 out of 10 as while the images make sense, there are no elements of interest 


### Negative Aspects of Original Visualization
One of the largest critiques of the initial visualization stems around very long image which is not effective to display the message. Another issue of
