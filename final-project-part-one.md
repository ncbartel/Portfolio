# Outline

One of the greatest threats to American Democracy is polarization. Americans are seeing each other as hating everything the other one is with the "If you are not with me, then you are my enemy" mindset. However, the data suggests that this simply is not true. There are a lot of common issues that Americans agree on, but political messaging makes it seem like we do not. 

One controversial area is with climate change. It has faced corporate influence from trying to prevent policy changes to trying to take advantage of green policies and has also dealt with politicalization of science. With this project, I want to wipe away the polarization and past narratives of the "tree hugging left" and the "drill baby drill right" to see how Americans actually want to see change. 

In Spring 2023, I conducted nationwide survey of 1,300 Americans from across the country looking people's perspectives on climate change, their self-assessed level of knowledge in energy policy, and where they think our energy comes from and how they would envision it changing in their ideal world. While conducting this survey and using this data for a senior capstone project, I want to take a previously academic approach in the story this data was telling and tell a more personal story of how Americans across the US feel when it comes to American energy using tools from Telling Stories with Data class. 

There are three stories I want to tell with my data:
1. Our ideas about where our energy comes differs from where it actually does
2. Americans want more renewable energy across the board 
3. The impact of views on climate change impacting different desired energy portfolios
